* LeetBot
** Setup

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cp .env.example .env

    # adjust parameters in .env

    docker-compose build

    docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

The bots now connect to the telegram api and all should be good.

** What does it do?

Made specifically for a group with friends from uni.

The bot tracks, how many people write "1337" in the time from 13:37 to 13:38
every day and then either reports the count and participants or tells people off
who interrupt the leeting with inappropriate behavior.

Careful: The translation files contain vulgar language.
