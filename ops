Since currently only chats that are `enabled` exist in the store, the used language can only be configured for chats in which the bot is active.\n\nTo make the language configurable per chat, first #36 has to be done, since then the `chat` object is kept around even for disabled chats. Then a `chat` object needs to be created for single-person chats as well, so that they can configure the language in which the bot is talking to them.\n\n- [ ] Wait for #36\n- [ ] Make /start create the chat object instead of /enable, so that every chat that interacts with the bot has an object in the store (This should already be done in #36)\n- [ ] Write unit tests\n\nHopefully after #36 there will be nothing to do here except writing tests. This issue mainly exists as a reminder of the intent to change the language handling.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"cbda4c3e0f8cfde4151088caf421bf19e91d2a73"},"timestamp":1575998615,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4NzEzOTQ3MzA="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]}]}
