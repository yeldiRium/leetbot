I wanted it to be slim and to only persist what is absolutely necessary. But since we need the historical data for various purposes (see e.g. #35) we need to persist some data.\n\nWe will probably need to remodel the state to contain:\n\n- history of successes and failures for a chat (how detailed? how long?)\n- history of the highscore for a chat (each new highscore?)\n- history of success and failures for each individual participant (per chat? across all chats?)\n\nAny other data that is currently available but is not persisted (and makes sense to keep)?","files":null}]}
