So far my choice is [`reselect`](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) which is made with `react` in mind but seems to be suited for this use-case as well.\n\nTo Dos:\n\n- [ ] Remove `redux-combine-getters`\n- [ ] Add `reselect`\n- [ ] Rewrite all the getters using `reselect`\n  - [ ] Rewrite all the tests accordingly\n- [ ] Adjust all places where the getters are used\n\nThings to note:\n\n- The current getters generated by `redux-combine-getters` accept either a plain state object or a redux state object. The selectors generated by `reselect` only accept plain state objects. Thus the calls to them have to be changed into e.g. `leetPeopleInChat(state.getState())` instead of just `leetPeopleInChat(state)`.\n- The signatures of some of the getters might change in the process. This is encouraged, since some of them are pretty shit at the moment.","files":null}]}
