If this happens with multiple participants, `isLeetLegit` will return false, since `undefined` is already present in the `leetPeople`.\n\nThen the bot tries to notify the \"asshole\" but fails to convert their non-existing username to uppercase, which results in an exception. Thus the timeout is not aborted and the bot stops.\nNo further messages are processed and the current information timeout keeps running until it has informed about the current state.\nThe timout for the pin also finishes and then the whole app stops.","files":null}]}
