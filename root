I only maintain git tags and no versioning in the project (which I should probably do). But even if I always update the `package.json`, the bundled package has no access to that. So I'd have to add a buildstep where the version is injected into the bundle.\n\nUsing a commit hash is almost as bad.\n\nBest option probably: Set the version in some environment variable and display that.","files":null}]}
